        <h2>ReBottle Art Project Overview</h2>
        <p>The ReBottle Art Project is MCCRI's flagship programme. Its mission is to encourage the collection and reuse of glass bottles for artistic purposes. Participants from across Manchester gather to collect bottles of all shapes, sizes, and colours. These bottles are then cleaned, sorted, and transformed into a wide range of artworks including installations, mosaics, lamps, and decorative pieces.</p>
        <p>Each year, the project attracts over 600 participants, including students, young designers, and environmentally conscious citizens. The final artworks are displayed at the annual "Manchester Green Creativity Exhibition", drawing visitors from the community and media coverage from local outlets.</p>
